An object-oriented TicTacToe game completed as part of Tealeaf Academy's 'Introduction to Ruby and Web Development'.

I found this assignment less challenging than the procedural completed in Lesson 1.

I took a 'programming by wishful thinking' approach to this and it made creating a structure for class and methods a lot less stressful and more straightforward.

Let me know if there's anything that you did/would do differently!
